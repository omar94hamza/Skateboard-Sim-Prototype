## Skateboarding Simulator Game - UE5 Prototype

 # Overview
 This project is a 3D Skateboarding Simulator Game developed using Unreal Engine 5.3 and C++. It features a fully controllable skateboarding character with movement, jumping, speed-up, slow-down mechanics, and a points system for jumping over obstacles. The project is designed as a technical prototype for evaluation purposes, focusing on gameplay functionality, code organization, and quality.

 # Targeted Features
 - Character Movement: Smooth and responsive skateboard controls (forward, backward, left, and right).
 - Pushing Mechanic: Accelerate to increase speed.
 - Braking Mechanic: Slow down or stop the skateboard.
 - Jumping: Execute jumps using Mixamo animations to clear obstacles.
 - Points System: Earn points for successfully jumping over obstacles.
 - Level Design: A simple skate park environment with strategically placed obstacles.

# How to Play
1. Launch the game by running the .exe file from the packaged build.
2. Use the following controls:
  - Move Forward/Backward: [W/S]
  - Turn Left/Right: [A/D]
  - Push (Speed Up): [Shift]
  - Brake (Slow Down): [Ctrl]
  - Jump: [Spacebar]
3. Navigate through the level and jump over obstacles to earn points.

# Development Notes
 - Developed entirely in C++ without using Blueprints.
 - Assets used include Mixamo animations and simple meshes for the skate park environment.
 - GitHub was utilized for version control with incremental commits.
